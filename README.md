# Tips_10_07_GeometryReader_Begin
Use GeometryReader and Geometry Proxy to size Views in SwiftUI. In this tip we'll size buttons to use all available space, and resize fonts to use what is necessary. We'll do this for my iPad  to be a prop for my  costume  I made for a Science fiction convention, based on the books by Nathan Lowell. 

This was originally part of a cosplay of a Science fiction character.  To learn more about this cosplay and my experience, you can find that here http://www.sliceofapppie.com/2020/03/cosplay-coffee-and-story/

I was granted permission by author Nathan Lowell, who helped get this tabet working. I do need to give him and his books a shout out. You'll find allhis books on his Amazon author page here: https://www.amazon.com/Nathan-Lowell/e/B003D54RY4 

The story is not your regular Science fiction story of Empires, dramatic space battles, and aliens. It starts as a slice of life story about a guy forced to take a job on a spacehip in a menial job, but grows over the novels to one about business in space from the freight hauler's point of view. Lowell has a magic about his prose that will make you excited about a cup of coffe and selling belts at a flea market.
